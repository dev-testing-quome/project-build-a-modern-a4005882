* **Testing:**  (Specify testing framework used, e.g., pytest)


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm or yarn
* Docker (optional, but recommended for development consistency and deployment)
* A Stripe account (for payment processing)


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-build-a-modern
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application:**

   ```bash
   # Run the backend in a separate terminal
   cd ../backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

   # Run the frontend in another separate terminal
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```


### Docker Setup

1.  Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.  Access the application through the URLs specified in the "API Documentation" section.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the interactive API documentation at:

* **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI)
* **Alternative API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/redoc (ReDoc)


## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/products`:  GET request to retrieve a list of products.  Can include query parameters for filtering and pagination.
* `/products/{product_id}`: GET request to retrieve a specific product by ID.
* `/cart`:  POST request to add an item to the cart, GET request to view the cart contents.
* `/checkout`: POST request to initiate the checkout process.  Requires authentication.


**Sample Requests/Responses:**  (Provide specific examples using curl or other tools, showing request headers and JSON payloads)  For example:


```bash
# Example GET request to retrieve all products
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/products"
```

**Common Workflows:**  (Describe common user interactions, such as browsing products, adding to cart, and completing checkout).
