## Technical Architecture Document: project-build-a-modern

**1. System Overview:**

`project-build-a-modern` is a modern e-commerce platform designed for scalability, maintainability, and security.  We will employ a microservices-ready architecture using a layered approach. The backend will be built using FastAPI, providing a robust and efficient API. The frontend will leverage React with TypeScript for a dynamic and responsive user experience.  A clean separation of concerns will be maintained between the frontend, backend, and database layers.  The system will be designed to accommodate future expansion and integration of new features and services. Key design principles include modularity, loose coupling, and high cohesion.

**2. Folder Structure:**

The proposed folder structure is a solid starting point and will be refined iteratively.  We will add subfolders as needed to maintain organization as the project grows.  For example, the `services` folder might be further subdivided by domain (e.g., `services/product/`, `services/order/`).

**3. Technology Stack:**

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11), Uvicorn (ASGI server)
* **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Initially SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production; allows for better scalability and performance)
* **Caching:** Redis (for frequently accessed data like product catalogs)
* **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka (for asynchronous tasks like order processing and email notifications)
* **Search:** Elasticsearch (for advanced product search and filtering)
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* **Payment Gateway:** Stripe API
* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (for production deployment)
* **CI/CD:** GitLab CI/CD or GitHub Actions


**4. Database Design:**

We will use a relational database (PostgreSQL) with SQLAlchemy ORM.  The schema will include tables for users, products, categories, shopping carts, orders, order items, reviews, and inventory.  Relationships will be defined using foreign keys to ensure data integrity.  Data modeling will follow normalization principles to minimize redundancy and improve data consistency.  Migrations will be managed using Alembic.

**5. API Design:**

A RESTful API will be implemented using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Endpoints will be organized logically by resource (e.g., `/users`, `/products`, `/orders`).  Request/response bodies will be defined using Pydantic schemas for validation and data serialization.  Authentication will be handled using JWTs.  Detailed API documentation will be generated using OpenAPI/Swagger.

**6. Security Architecture:**

* **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with secure token generation and validation.
* **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive resources.
* **Data Protection:** Input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and HTTPS for secure communication.  Data encryption at rest and in transit.
* **Security Best Practices:** Regular security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning.  Implementation of OWASP security recommendations.

**7. Frontend Architecture:**

* **Component Organization:**  Component-based architecture using React functional components and hooks.
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or Zustand for managing application state.
* **Routing:** React Router for client-side routing.
* **API Integration:**  Fetch API or Axios for making API requests.  Error handling and loading states will be implemented.

**8. Integration Points:**

* **Stripe API:**  For payment processing.
* **Email Service:**  SendGrid or Mailgun for sending order updates and other notifications.
* **Data Exchange Formats:** JSON for API communication.
* **Error Handling:**  Centralized error handling with custom exception classes and appropriate HTTP status codes.


**9. Development Workflow:**

* **Local Development:** Docker Compose for setting up a local development environment.
* **Testing:**  Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using pytest (backend) and Jest/Cypress (frontend).  Test coverage will be a key metric.
* **Build and Deployment:**  CI/CD pipeline using Docker images and Kubernetes for automated deployment to staging and production environments.
* **Environment Management:**  Environment variables and configuration files for managing different environments (development, staging, production).


**10. Scalability Considerations:**

* **Performance Optimization:**  Database query optimization, caching strategies (Redis), efficient algorithms, and asynchronous task processing (RabbitMQ/Kafka).
* **Load Balancing:**  Using a load balancer (e.g., Nginx) to distribute traffic across multiple backend instances.
* **Database Scaling:**  PostgreSQL's built-in scaling capabilities and potential for read replicas.
* **Microservices:**  The architecture is designed to be easily broken down into microservices as the application grows, allowing for independent scaling of individual components.


**Timeline and Resource Requirements:**

This project will be broken down into phases, with iterative development and continuous integration.  A detailed project plan with specific timelines and resource allocation will be developed.  The initial phase will focus on core features (user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout).  Subsequent phases will add more advanced features and integrations.

**Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Database performance issues, API integration challenges, security vulnerabilities.  Mitigation: Thorough testing, performance monitoring, security audits, and proactive vulnerability management.
* **Business Risks:**  Market competition, user adoption, payment gateway integration issues.  Mitigation:  Market research, user feedback, robust testing, and contingency plans.


This document provides a high-level architectural overview.  Further detailed design specifications will be developed as the project progresses.  The architecture is designed to be flexible and adaptable to changing business requirements and technological advancements.  Regular reviews and adjustments will be made to ensure alignment with business objectives and maintain a high-quality, scalable, and secure e-commerce platform.
