# Deployment Guide - project-build-a-modern

This guide outlines the deployment process for "project-build-a-modern," a modern e-commerce platform.  This guide assumes familiarity with command-line interfaces, Docker, and at least one cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  Specific commands and configurations may need adjustments based on your chosen cloud provider and infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

### Required Software and Tools

* Docker: `https://www.docker.com/`
* Docker Compose: `https://docs.docker.com/compose/`
* Git: `https://git-scm.com/`
* Node.js and npm (or yarn): `https://nodejs.org/`
* A Cloud Provider Account (AWS, GCP, or Azure - choose one)
* Text editor or IDE

### System Requirements

* Minimum 4GB RAM, recommended 8GB+
* Minimum 2 CPU cores, recommended 4+ cores
* Sufficient storage space for application data and logs

### Account Setup

* **Cloud Provider:** Create an account with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  You will need appropriate billing information and potentially a project/account setup.
* **Stripe:** Create a Stripe account to enable payment processing.  You'll need your API keys for integration.


## Environment Setup

### Environment Variables Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.  This file will contain sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.  **Do not commit this file to version control.**  Example:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@host:port/database"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your_stripe_secret_key"
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_stripe_publishable_key"
SESSION_SECRET="a_very_long_random_string"
NODE_ENV="production"  # or "development"
```

### Database Setup

This guide assumes a PostgreSQL database.  Adapt as needed for other databases.

1. **Create Database:** Create a PostgreSQL database instance on your chosen cloud provider or locally using `psql`.
2. **Configure Connection:** Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file with your database credentials.

### External Service Configuration

* **Stripe:** Configure your Stripe account and obtain your secret and publishable keys.  Place these in your `.env` file.
* **Email Service:** Configure an email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) and obtain API credentials. Add these to your `.env` file.


## Docker Deployment

### Building the Docker Image

Navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

This command builds the Docker image defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.  Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` file correctly defines the application's dependencies and environment variables.  Example:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}
      - ... other environment variables
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=database
```

### Running with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts the application and database containers in detached mode.

### Environment Configuration

All environment variables should be set in the `.env` file.  Docker Compose will automatically load these into the containers.

### Health Checks and Monitoring

Implement health checks within your application to ensure it's running correctly.  You can use Docker's healthcheck feature in your `docker-compose.yml` to monitor the application's health.  You'll also need external monitoring tools (see Monitoring & Logging section).


## Production Deployment

### Cloud Deployment Options

* **AWS:** Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EKS for deploying your Docker containers.
* **GCP:** Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Cloud Run.
* **Azure:** Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instances (ACI).

### Container Orchestration

Use Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) or Docker Swarm for managing and scaling your containers across multiple nodes.

### Load Balancing and Scaling

Configure a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancing, GCP Cloud Load Balancing, Azure Load Balancer) to distribute traffic across multiple application instances.  Scale your application horizontally by adding more containers as needed.

### SSL/TLS Configuration

Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., Let's Encrypt) and configure your load balancer or reverse proxy to use it.


## Database Setup

### Database Migration Commands

Your application should have a mechanism for managing database migrations (e.g., using Sequelize, Prisma, or TypeORM).  Run the migration commands as part of your deployment process.

### Initial Data Setup

Seed your database with initial data (e.g., product categories, default users) using seed scripts.

### Backup and Recovery Procedures

Implement regular database backups using your cloud provider's tools or dedicated backup solutions.  Establish a recovery procedure to restore from backups in case of failure.


## Monitoring & Logging

### Application Monitoring Setup

Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to monitor application metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency).

### Log Aggregation

Use a centralized logging system like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack) or a managed logging service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, GCP Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor) to collect and analyze logs from all application components.

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) like website load time, conversion rates, and average order value.

### Error Tracking

Use error tracking tools like Sentry or Rollbar to capture and analyze application errors.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

* **Connection Errors:** Check database credentials and network connectivity.
* **Port Conflicts:** Ensure that the ports used by your application are not already in use.
* **Environment Variable Issues:** Verify that environment variables are correctly set and accessible to your application.

### Debug Commands

* `docker logs <container_name>`: View logs from a specific container.
* `docker exec -it <container_name> bash`: Access a container's shell for debugging.

### Log Locations

Log locations will depend on your application's logging configuration.  Check your application's documentation for details.

### Recovery Procedures

* Restore from database backups.
* Roll back to a previous deployment version.


## Security Considerations

### Environment Variable Security

Do not hardcode sensitive information in your code.  Use environment variables and secure storage mechanisms (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault).

### Network Security

Use firewalls and other network security measures to protect your application from unauthorized access.

### Authentication Setup

Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user accounts and data.

### Regular Security Updates

Keep your application and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.


This guide provides a general framework.  Specific commands and configurations will vary based on your chosen technologies and cloud provider.  Remember to consult the documentation for your specific tools and services.  Thorough testing in a staging environment before deploying to production is crucial.
